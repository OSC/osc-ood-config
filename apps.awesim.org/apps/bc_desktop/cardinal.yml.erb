  This app will launch an interactive desktop on one or more compute nodes. It is
  a large environment for when you need a lot of compute and/or memory resources because 
  you will have full access to all the resources on that compute node(s).
  
  If you do not need all these resources, use the 
  [Lightweight Desktop](/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/bc_desktop/vdi/session_contexts/new)
  app instead which is much more lightweight for general-purpose use cases.

      - **any** - (*28 cores*) Chooses anyone of the available Cardinal nodes.
        This reduces the wait time as you have no requirements.
      - **vis** - (*28 cores*) This node includes an NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU with
        an X server running in the background. This allows for Hardware
        Rendering with the GPU typically needed for 3D visualization using
        VirtualGL. There are currently only 10 of these nodes on Owens.
      - **gpu** -  (*28 cores*) This node includes an NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU
        allowing for CUDA computations. There are currently only 160 of these
        nodes on Cardinal. These nodes don't start an X server, so visualization
        with hardware rendering is not possible.
      - **hugemem** - (*48 cores*) This Owens node has 1.5TB of available RAM
        as well as 48 cores. There are 16 of these nodes on Owens.
