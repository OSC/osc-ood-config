      - **any** - (*40 cores*) Chooses anyone of the available Pitzer nodes.
        This reduces the wait time as you have no requirements.
      - **vis** - (*40 cores*) This requests a gpu node as described below,
        with the addition that it starts an X server running in the background.
        This allows for Hardware Rendering with the GPU typically needed for
        3D visualization using VirtualGL.
      - **gpu** - (*40 cores*) This node includes two NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs
        allowing for CUDA computations. There are currently only 32 of these
        nodes on Pitzer. These nodes don't start an X server, so visualization
        with hardware rendering is not possible.
      - **hugemem** - (*80 cores*) This Pitzer node has 3TB of available RAM as
        well as 80 cores. There are only 4 of these nodes on Pitzer. A
        reservation may be required to use this node.
