cluster: "pitzer"
description: |
  This app will launch an interactive desktop on one or more compute nodes. It is
  a large environment for when you need a lot of compute and/or memory resources because 
  you will have full access to all the resources on that compute node(s).
  
  If you do not need all these resources, use the 
  [Pitzer VDI](/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/bc_desktop/vdi-pitzer/session_contexts/new)
  app instead which is much more lightweight for general-purpose use cases.

      - **Standard Compute** <br>
        These are standard HPC machines. There are 224 with 40 cores and
        340 with 48. They all have 192 GB of RAM. Chosing any will decrease
        your wait time.
      - **GPU Enabled** <br>
        These are HPC machines with [NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs]. They have the same
        40 core machines have 2 GPUs with 16 GB of RAM and 48 core machines have 2
        with 32 GB of RAM.  Densegpu types have 4 GPUs with 16 GB of RAM.
        Visualization nodes are GPU enabled nodes with an X Server in the background
        for 3D visualization using VirtualGL.
      - **Large Memory** <br>
        These are HPC machines with very large amounts of memory. Largmem nodes
        have 48 cores with 768 GB of RAM. Hugemem nodes have 80 cores with 3 TB of RAM.
