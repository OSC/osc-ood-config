      - **any** - (*20 cores*) Chooses anyone of the available Ruby nodes.
        This reduces the wait time as you have no requirements.
      - **vis** - (*20 cores*) This node includes an NVIDIA Tesla K40 GPU with
        an X server running in the background. This allows for Hardware
        Rendering with the GPU typically needed for 3D visualization using
        VirtualGL. There are currently only 4 of these nodes on Ruby.
      - **gpu** -  (*20 cores*) This node includes an NVIDIA Tesla K40 GPU
        allowing for CUDA computations. There are currently only 20 of these
        nodes on Ruby. These nodes don't start an X server, so visualization
        with hardware rendering is not possible.
      - **hugemem** - (*32 cores*) This Ruby node has 1TB of available
        RAM as well as 32 cores. There is only 1 of these nodes on Ruby. A
        reservation may be required to use this node.
