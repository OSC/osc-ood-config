  This app will launch an interactive desktop on a **shared node** that we have
  termed a Virtual Desktop Interface (VDI). This is analogous to an interactive
  login node as you will be sharing it with multiple users and you *should* be
  provisioned a desktop nearly immediately.

  This is meant for lightweight tasks (similar to a login node) such as:

  - accessing & viewing files
  - submitting jobs
  - compiling code
  - running visualization software
