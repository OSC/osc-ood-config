  This app will launch an interactive desktop with one core which could be shared. It
  is a small environment for lightweight tasks (similar to a login node) such as accessing
  & viewing files, submitting jobs, compiling code, and running visualization software.
  You should be provisioned a desktop nearly immediately.

  If you need dedicated resources for compute or memory intensive workloads use the 
  [Owens Desktop](/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/bc_desktop/owens/session_contexts/new) 
  app where you will have full access to them.
