        Hello OpenMP World prints the number of threads and the current thread id.
        This example uses 1 node with 28 cores, which is suitable for Owens. A similar job on Oakley would use 12 cores; the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable would also be set to 8. A program must be written to take advantage of multithreading for this to work.
