title: "Pitzer-exp Desktop"
cluster: "pitzer-exp"
description: |
  This app will launch an interactive desktop on one or more compute nodes. It is
  a large environment for when you need a lot of compute and/or memory resources because 
  you will have full access to all the resources on that compute node(s).
  
  If you do not need all these resources, use the 
  [Pitzer VDI](/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/bc_desktop/vdi-pitzer/session_contexts/new)
  app instead which is much more lightweight for general-purpose use cases.

      This will launch either the [Xfce] or [Mate] desktop environment on the
      [Pitzer cluster].

      - **any** - (*48 cores*) Chooses anyone of the available Pitzer Expansion nodes.
        This reduces the wait time as you have no requirements. Standard Pitzer
        nodes have 192GB of memory.
      - **vis** - (*48 cores*) This requests a gpu node as described below,
        with the addition that it starts an X server running in the background.
        This allows for Hardware Rendering with the GPU typically needed for
        3D visualization using VirtualGL.
      - **gpu** - (*48 cores*) This node includes two NVIDIA Volta V100 GPUs
        allowing for CUDA computations. This node has 384GB of memory.
        There are currently 42 of these nodes on Pitzer.
        These nodes don't start an X server, so visualization with hardware
        rendering is not possible.
      - **densegpu** - (*48 cores*) This Pitzer Expanson node is similar to gpu
        but has 768GB of memory and 48 cores per node. It also includes four 
        NVIDIA Volta V100 GPUs for CUDA computations
      - **largemem** - (*48 cores*) This Pitzer Expansion node has 768GB of memory as
        well as 48 cores. There are 12 of these nodes on Pitzer Expansion.
