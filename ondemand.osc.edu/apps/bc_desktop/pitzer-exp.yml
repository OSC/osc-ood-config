  title: "Pitzer Expansion Desktop"
  cluster: "pitzer-exp"
  description: |
    This app will launch an interactive desktop on one or more compute nodes. It is
    a large environment for when you need a lot of compute and/or memory resources because 
    you will have full access to all the resources on that compute node(s).
    
    If you do not need all these resources, use the 
    [Pitzer VDI](/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/bc_desktop/vdi-pitzer/session_contexts/new)
    app instead which is much more lightweight for general-purpose use cases.

        Pitzer Expansion cluster.

        - **any** - (*48 cores*) Chooses anyone of the available Pitzer Expansion nodes.
          This reduces the wait time as you have no requirements. Standard Pitzer
          Expansion nodes have 192GB of memory.
        - **gpu** - (*48 cores*) This node includes two NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs
          allowing for CUDA computations. This node has 384GB of memory.
          There are currently only 42 of these nodes on Pitzer Expansion.
          These nodes don't start an X server, so visualization with hardware
          rendering is not possible.  
        - **densegpu** - (*48 cores*) This node includes four NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs
          allowing for CUDA computations. This node has 768GB of memory.
          There are currently only 4 of these nodes on Pitzer Expansion.
          These nodes don't start an X server, so visualization with hardware
          rendering is not possible.
