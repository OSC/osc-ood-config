  The Virtual Desktop Interfaces should not be used for computationally or memory intensive
  processes because it is a shared resource and there are other users on the same node.
  Such processes will be terminated.

  If you need dedicated resources for compute or memory intensive workloads use the 
  [Owens Desktop](/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/bc_desktop/owens/session_contexts/new) 
  app where you will have full access to them.

      This will launch either the [Xfce] or [Mate] desktop environment on the
