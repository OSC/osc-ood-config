title: "Lightweight Desktop"
description: |
  This app will launch an interactive desktop with one core which could be shared. It
  is a small environment for lightweight tasks (similar to a login node) such as accessing
  & viewing files, submitting jobs, compiling code, and running visualization software.
  You should be provisioned a desktop nearly immediately.

  If you need dedicated resources for compute or memory intensive workloads use a
  Desktop app like [Pitzer] or [Ascend] where you will have full access to them.

      This will launch either the [Xfce] or [Mate] desktop environment on the
      [Owens] or [Pitzer] clusters.
