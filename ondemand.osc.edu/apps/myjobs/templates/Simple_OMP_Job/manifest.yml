notes: >
        Hello OpenMP World prints the number of threads and the current thread id.
        This example uses 1 node with 12 cores, which is suitable for Oakley. A similar job on Glenn would use 8 cores; the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable would also be set to 8. A program must be written to take advantage of multithreading for this to work.
