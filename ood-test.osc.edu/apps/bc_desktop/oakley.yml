  This app will launch an interactive desktop on one or more compute nodes. You
  will have full access to the resources these nodes provide. This is analogous
  to an interctive batch job.

      - **any** - (*12 cores*) Chooses anyone of the available Oakley nodes.
        This reduces the wait time as you have no requirements.
      - **vis** - (*12 cores*) This node includes an NVIDIA Tesla M2070 GPU
        with an X server running in the background. This allows for Hardware
        Rendering with the GPU typically needed for 3D visualization using
        VirtualGL. There are currently only 128 of these nodes on Oakley.
      - **gpu** -  (*12 cores*) This node includes an NVIDIA Tesla M2070 GPU
        allowing for CUDA computations. There are currently only 128 of these
        nodes on Oakley. These nodes don't start an X server, so visualization
        with hardware rendering is not possible.
      - **bigmem** - (*12 cores*) This Oakley node comes with 192GB of
        available RAM. There are only 8 of these nodes on Oakley.
      - **hugemem** - (*32 cores*) This Oakley node has 1TB of available RAM as
        well as 32 cores. There is only 1 of these nodes on Oakley. A
        reservation may be required to use this node.
